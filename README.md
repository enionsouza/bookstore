# Bookstore

## About

The Bookstore is a website similar to the ["Awesome Books"](https://github.com/VanessaAoki/AwesomeBooks/) website built in the previous Microverse module (see [live version](https://rawcdn.githack.com/VanessaAoki/AwesomeBooks/3ca746caa2332a3bc69bb2846545a09298e8045f/index.html)). My goal here is to create an MVP version of it that allows the user to:

-    Display a list of books.
-    Add a book.
-    Remove a selected book.

By building this application, I will learn how to use React and Redux.

A screenshot of the Books page of the app is presented below:
