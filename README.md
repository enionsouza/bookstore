# Bookstore

## About

The Bookstore is a website similar to the ["Awesome Books"](https://github.com/VanessaAoki/AwesomeBooks/) website built in the previous Microverse module, with pure JavaScript (see [live version](https://rawcdn.githack.com/VanessaAoki/AwesomeBooks/3ca746caa2332a3bc69bb2846545a09298e8045f/index.html)). My goal here is to create an MVP version of it, using ReactJS and Redux, to allow the user to:

-    Display a list of books (accessing the 'bookstore' API provided by Microverse).
-    Add a book ('ADD BOOK' button).
-    Remove a selected book ('Remove' link).

A screenshot of the Books page is presented below:
